# winter-break-2022
<p>This repository is for my random coding throughout winter break 2022. This follows my first programming course (Introduction to Computer Science/Programming in Java) and I wanted to get a bit of practice in before moving on to Data Structures.</p>
<p> A quick note: The sudoku project is not finished and is not intended to be. Pursuing sudoku before taking data structures seems to be a waste of time, so I've just set up a little bit of the background.</p>
