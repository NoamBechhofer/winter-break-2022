This was a cool waste of a Friday afternoon. And I still got to go to Bryant
Park with a few friends afterward. Anyway.
Welcome to Numberwang!
This "game" (if I may ruin the name of game for all games) is based on the game
show from the TV show That Mitchell and Webb Look. More info:
https://thatmitchellandwebb.fandom.com/wiki/Numberwang!. Basically, most every
aspect of Numberwang uses randomness for comedic effect. The same ethos has
guided the development of this program, though I do admit playing this game
isn't all that funny.

I've included a GameTester file which you can run to play Numberwang from
command line. In general you play by instantiating a Game and calling its play()
method. Sorry I haven't learned javadoc yet so that's all you're gonna get from
me.

The Fortune file acts like a fortune cookie, just like BSD Fortune.
Credit for the fortunes goes to Josh Madison.
