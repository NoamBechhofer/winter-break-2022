Welcome to Numberwang!
This "game" (if I may ruin the name of game for all games) is based on the game
show from the TV show That Mitchell and Webb Look. More info:
https://thatmitchellandwebb.fandom.com/wiki/Numberwang!. Basically, most every
aspect of Numberwang uses randomness for comedic effect. The same ethos has
guided the development of this program.

I've included a GameTester file which you can run to play Numberwang from
command line. In general you play by instantiating a Game and calling its play()
method.

The Fortune file acts like a fortune cookie, just like BSD Fortune.
Credit for the fortunes goes to Josh Madison.
